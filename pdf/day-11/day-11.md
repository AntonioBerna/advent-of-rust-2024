# Day 11

###### Santa's Snowy Algorithm

---

## The Story

"LISTEN UP, YOU MAGNIFICENT, STRESSED-OUT CODERS!" Santa bellowed. "Tomorrow, we test the sleigh again. And this time, it WILL work. No more Florida nonsense. Palm trees are NOT part of the Christmas aesthetic."

---

## The Story

He pointed dramatically at Bernard and Pepper. "You two are coming with me. If the sleigh glitches mid-flight again, I want live debugging happening in real time. No excuses".

---

## The Story

The elves whispered nervously. Everyone still remembered the "Florida Incident"â€”last week's failed test landing in a snowless golf course. Santa didn't appreciate the HOA complaints.

---

## The Story

"This time," Santa continued, pacing, "Snowball compiled every scrap of data we need for each location. Top-notch metrics. But metrics mean nothing without an algorithm. Your job is to write a function to find the snowball-densest landing spot".

---

## Your Mission

Snowball has provided you with a `Vec<Location>`, now the other elves need to write a function to find the most dense area with snow.

Here is what you need to to:

- Write a `new()` [associated function](https://www.rustfinity.com/learn/rust/structs/implementing-methods#associated-functions) for the `Location` struct that takes `x: f64`, `y: f64`, `z: f64`, `area: f64`, and `snow`.

---

## Your Mission

- The `snow` parameter must be able to accept all `SnowKg`, `SnowLb` and `Snowball` types.
- Implement a method for the `Location` struct named `density()` that gets the density of snow in the location.
- Finish the `find_best_location` function which takes a `Vec<Location>` and returns a `Result<Location, Box<dyn Error>>`.

That's it! ðŸŽ…

---

## Hints

If you're stuck or need a starting point, here are some hints to help you along the way!

---

## Hints

- When we implemented the `From<T>` trait in the previous challenge, Rust automatically implemented the `Into<T>` trait for us. This means that if you implement `From<T>` for a type, you can convert that type to `T` using the `into()` method. e.g. `let snow = snow.into();`.

---

## Hints

- For the `snow` parameter, you can accept anything that implements the `Into<Snowball>` trait. e.g. `new(x: f64, y: f64, z: f64, area: f64, snow: impl Into<Snowball>) -> Self`. Here `impl Into<Snowball>` means any type that implements the `Into<Snowball>` trait.

---

## Hints

- Convert the `snow` parameter to a `Snowball` type using the `into()` method. e.g. `let snow = snow.into();`.

- Implement the `density()` method for the `Location` struct. The density of snow is calculated by dividing the snow weight by the area of the location. Make sure you handle the division by zero case.

---

## Hints

- Use `into_iter` to convert the `Vec<Location>` to a consuming iterator. e.g. `locations.into_iter()`.

---

## Hints

Use the `max_by()` method to find the location with the highest density of snow. e.g.

```rust
locations
    .into_iter()
    .max_by(|a, b| {
        a.density()
            .partial_cmp(&b.density())
            .unwrap_or(Ordering::Equal)
    })
```

---

## Hints

- Import `Ordering::Equal` using use `std::cmp::Ordering`.

- Use the `ok_or()` method to convert the `Option` returned by `max_by()` to a `Result`. e.g. `ok_or("No locations found".into())`.
