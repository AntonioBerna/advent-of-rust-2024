Learn and Practice Rust by solving daily challenges for a month on Advent of Rust 2024.

## What is Advent of Rust?

Advent of code is a great way to improve your programming skills. It's a month-long event where you can learn Rust by solving daily challenges. Each day, a new challenge is released, and you have 24 hours to solve it. The challenges are designed to be fun and educational, and they cover a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to advanced algorithms.

Advent of Rust is just like Advent of Code, but with a focus on Rust, we'll focus on the core Rust language features like Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes, and more.
